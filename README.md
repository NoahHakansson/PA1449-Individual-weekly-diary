### Total in project: 59h 

### ACTIVITY/TASKS & RESULT
| Task    | hours    | Progress %    | Result    |
|-------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Setup CI/CD | 3    | 90/100        | CI/CD is done, only some small changes will be needed, after we implement testing in the frontend repo.|
                                     | Setting up CI/CD went pretty smoothly as i have done it before many times on GitHub, |
                                     | but as this was on GitLab it required a little bit of reaserch before implementing it. |
                                     | But it was pretty straight forward and easy. |
| Item1.2    | Item2.2   | Item3.2   | Item4.2   |
| Item1.3   | Item2.3   | Item3.3   | Item4.3   |

We created a risk analysis on Monday and continued on requirements and creating our backlog. The rest of the week was mostly continuing work on our backlog to prepare for sprint 1. We did also meet on Wednesday with a guy studying the AI program to have some discussions about how we can train our AI, what model to use and other things, he provided us with some good resources.

### PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS 
Again we had some problems with GitLab, we started out using issues and in the issues creating tasks. But we noticed the tasks are quite limited in what you can write in them. and assigning of tasks in a issue is not great. What we found instead is milestones that can contain issues. So we converted our big issues into milestones and our tasks into issues in this milestone instead.

### REFLECTION  
Same as last week I think it was a productive week. I feel like we are quite well prepared for sprint 1.

## WEEK: 5

- Meetings/Group work 11h
- Lego 4h
- Individual work 1h
### Total in project: 35h 

### ACTIVITY & RESULT
This week we continued on creating issue and tasks for our backlog. We finished the main issues for our MVP. Next week we will continue breaking these issues into smaller tasks. And assign them to the team for sprint 1.

### PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS 
We have had some issues with GitLab and their boards and backlog features, but after some looking around we have managed to find a nice way to work with it.

### REFLECTION  
Was a good and productive week, we are almost done with preparations so that we can hit the ground running on sprint 1.

## WEEK: 4 
### This week: 19h
### Total in project: 19h 

### ACTIVITY & RESULT
We all joined a discord server group together and started talking and getting to know each other. Worked on canvas assignments. We have contacted the customer and decided what time a meeting would work for all of us. We had a meeting at their office this Monday and stayed there working together and discussing our assignments and presentation. Me and the other requirements engineer wrote down some requirements based on the small amount of verbal info we have gotten so far from the customer, and we are planning to discuss this at our next meeting next Monday. We also had our team and LeSS presentation. Lastly on Friday we all gathered in Space lab and discussed all the requirements together improving and adding a lot if information. We also started discussing some libraries and technologies that we are going to use. As we are going to use `Node.js` and we need web sockets we have decided on the `socket.io` library.

### PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS 
We had some problems deciding what language we wanted to use. At first we decided to use GoLang as it was stated as one of the options in the first document from the customer. But then they said we can't use GoLang and have to choose between JavaScript and Java. We were split on this decision, so we took a vote and JavaScript won with 6/10 votes.

### REFLECTION  
I think we have had a good and productive week considering it is only they first week, we have gotten to know each other better and laughed a lot which I think is very important if we are going to work together for 6 months as a successful team.
