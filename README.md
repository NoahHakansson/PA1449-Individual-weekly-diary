# Weekly Diary - Noah HÃ¥kansson

## WEEK: 4 
This week: 15 h 
Total in project: 15 h 

### ACTIVITY & RESULT
We all joined a discord server group together and started talking and getting to know each other. Worked on canvas assignments. We have contacted the customer and decided what time a meeting would work for all of us. We had a metting at their office this monday and stayed there working together and discussing our assignments and presentation. Me and the other requirements engineer wrote down some requirements based on the small amount of verbal info we have gotten so far from the customer, and we are planning to discuss this at our next meeting next monday. We also had our team and LeSS presentation.

### PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS 
We hade some problems deceding what langueage we wanted to use. At first we decided to use GoLang as it was stated as one of the options in the first document from the customer. But then they said we can't use GoLang and have to choose between Javascript and Java. We were split on this decision, so we took a vote and Javascript won with 6/10 votes.

### REFLECTION  
I think we have had a good and productive week considering it is only they first week, we have gotten to know eachother better and laughed a lot which is good and very important if we are going to work together as a successful team.
