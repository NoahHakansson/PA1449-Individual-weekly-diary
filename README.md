# Weekly Diary - Noah HÃ¥kansson

## WEEK: 4 
- This week: 19 h
- Total in project: 19 h 

### ACTIVITY & RESULT
We all joined a discord server group together and started talking and getting to know each other. Worked on canvas assignments. We have contacted the customer and decided what time a meeting would work for all of us. We had a meeting at their office this Monday and stayed there working together and discussing our assignments and presentation. Me and the other requirements engineer wrote down some requirements based on the small amount of verbal info we have gotten so far from the customer, and we are planning to discuss this at our next meeting next Monday. We also had our team and LeSS presentation. Lastly on Friday we all gathered in Space lab and discussed all the requirements together improving and adding a lot if information. We also started discussing some libraries and technologies that we are going to use. As we are going to use `Node.js` and we need web sockets we have decided on the `socket.io` library.

### PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS 
We had some problems deciding what language we wanted to use. At first we decided to use GoLang as it was stated as one of the options in the first document from the customer. But then they said we can't use GoLang and have to choose between JavaScript and Java. We were split on this decision, so we took a vote and JavaScript won with 6/10 votes.

### REFLECTION  
I think we have had a good and productive week considering it is only they first week, we have gotten to know each other better and laughed a lot which I think is very important if we are going to work together for 6 months as a successful team.
